\section{Results}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Example results (correction magnitude vs threshold for
  different nuclei) in detail. Note why cross-overs in
  correction-factor happen (has to do with energy-loss vs energy).
    \item Discuss estimated Pn corrections for some set of nuclei.
  \end{itemize}
